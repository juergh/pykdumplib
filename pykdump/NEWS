What's new in version 0.3?
--------------------------


Bugs fixed, some new features added:

- a new tPtr class ('typed pointer')
- we don't use pexpect and PTY-driver, instead we create a script for crash and
  run it
- new functions: uvtop and readProcessMem to read process's virtual memory,
  FD_ISSET and sLong to manipulate bits, getListSize to get the size of the
  linked list without returning its elements
- we determine HZ by consulting crash's machdep structure
- added global options to specify sysmap/vmlinux/vmcore manually:
   --vmcore=myvmcore
   --vmlinux /tmp/vmlinux

  (options are separated from arguments either with space or = sign)


What's new in version 0.2?
--------------------------

Many minor bugs fixed, some new features added:

- Support for multidimensional arrays

- Pointers to struct/union now are not just addresses but objects that
  contain type info

- New functions to read lists

- Pointers to functions are now processed differently from generic pointers
  This is needed on IA64 where they are really Function Descriptors

- Performance improvements in struct/union field access

- Documentation updated


- The companion 'LinuxDump' package now contains a powerful utility
  'xportshow.py' that can print many types of networking information:
  interface info, tunables, NETFILTER, routing, summary, IPv4/6 connections
  for kernels 2.4.20 - 2.6.20
