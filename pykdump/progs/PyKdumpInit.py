The detailed documentation is available on the WEB. Here are most useful
options:

--summary
    prints a summary of connections and warnings about unusual situations

-iv
    prints information about interfaces

-a
    prints information about connections. You can use extra specifiers
    similar to 'netstat' command, e.g. choose TCP only by adding -t

--everything
    prints most things, useful for sending the output to someone with
    networking expertise

Print information about NFS subsystem, both client and server.
As NFS functionality is implemented in DLKMs, we need to access
debuginfo for some of these modules. Depending on kernel version
these modules are different. Sometimes just one or two files are
enough; sometimes we need four of them:
   "nfs", "lockd", "nfsd", "sunrpc".
On a live kernel they are found automatically. With vmcore, you
need to extract them and put in the same directory where vmcore
is located.

Print information about UNINTERRUPTIBLE threads.
This is mosly useful when you have a hang and many Un threads. This program
will try to categorize them - for example, PIDs of all processes waiting for
mutexes/sempahores.

WARNING:
--------
Algorithms for finding addresses of mutexes/sempahores are
kernel-dependent and as a result, they are not 100% reliable for some
kernels. Still, they are quite useful for many 'production'
distributions such as RHEL{6,7} and SLES11.
