What's new in version 0.2?
--------------------------

The networking program 'xportshow.py' has been significantly extended and can
now print many things that are not easy to do manually:

- information about TCP/UDP/RAW/UNIX connections both for IPv4 and IPv6.
  This includes TIME_WAIT sockets that are not present at all in 'net -s'
  standard CRASH command

- print a summary about all connections and unusual situations, e.g. total
  number of TCP connections in different states, number of listen queues
  full, number of NAGLE enabled connections and flow-controlled TCP

- information about interfaces: IPv4/6 addresses (including multiple/alias),
  flags, features, Qdisc statistics, interface statistics for some drivers
  (e.g. loopback and tg3), last RX/TX timestamp

- protocol handler stack (ptype_all/ptype_base)

- registered NETFILTER hooks

- the list of tunable/value from sysctl tree (similar to 'sysctl -a')

- routing tables (at this moment only the main table for IPv4)


The program works on kernels from 2.4.20 to 2.6.20
