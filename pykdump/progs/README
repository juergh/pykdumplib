This is a Linux Dump-analysis library and some programs using it

License: GPL

At this moment this is mainly a proof of concept, the programs are not finished
yet. The main idea is to collect generic functions in a library LinuxDump,
to reuse them in applications. For example, a library function will return
a list of 'tcp_sock' structures obtained from different hash-tables, and then
applications will extract further details as needed. Some programs should be
useful for everybody - for example, printing routing tables from dump.

Installation
------------

Pre-requisite: 'pykdump' module and extension should be installed first

1. Run 'python setup.py install' - this will install 'LinuxDump' module.

2. There are three programs that are provided mainly for illustration
purposes. They are not complete yet, but are already quite useful!

- dev.py	- emulates 'dev' crash built-in

- netdev.py	- prints information about networking devices

- xportshow.py	- prints IPv4 info (similar to 'netstat -an'), routing table
		  and protocol handlers stack (those added by dev_add_pack())
