# fregsapi.py - API for the fregs crash extension that attempts to
# determine register contents at entry to each routine in stack frame

# Usage: search_for_registers(s)
#  
# The argument s is a BTstack object.  The function adds several attributes 
# to each frame in s.frames.  The key attribute is .reg, which is a (possibly 
# empty) dictionary of tuples of the form (contents, confidence), indexed by 
# the register name in upper case ("RDI", etc.)  Each tuple contains the 
# register contents and its confidence value; confidence ranges from 0 to 9, 
# with lower being better (0 is certainty).  So for a given frame f, 
# f.reg[REG][0] will contain the contents of REG upon entry to that routine, 
# with a confidence level of f.reg[REG][1].
#  
# Caveats: search_for_registers requires x86_64 architecture and att 
# disassembly flavor.  It checks the architecture and exits with an error 
# if not x86_64.  The caller is responsible for ensuring att disassembly 
# flavor; example usage is:
#  
#     with DisasmFlavor('att'):
#         try:
#             s = exec_bt("bt " + pid,MEMOIZE=False)[0]
#         except:
#             print "Unable to get stack trace"
#             sys.exit(1)
#         search_for_registers(s)
#
# The context handler DisasmFlavor will also set the output radix to 10 and restore it if needed,
# as the code assumes decimal outputs in some cases.

#
# General philosophy: try to find register contents that can be determined
# with a high degree of confidence and not too much work.  Don't try to
# figure everything out (which is probably impossible); this is a debugging
# aid, not a tool that attempts to do all crash analysis automatically.
